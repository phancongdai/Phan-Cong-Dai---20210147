- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

JAVA doesn't allow to do this.
Although we can create multiple constructors with the same name, but we can’t do it if the data type of parameters in these constructors are the same. In this case, “title” and “category” have the same initial data type: String.
